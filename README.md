My Portfolio

This is my personal Portfolio and it's here to showcase some of my work but it's also here to let you know a little About
me as a person and let you know what i'm up to currently because as a developer i'm constantly learning and implementing new skills.

Link: Rakimcraig.com

How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML, CSS

My goal here was to have mini sections so that the user can navigate to find whatever they want about me. Some people might be here to view my projects, some might just want to get to know a bit about me or some might want to know what i'm
currently doing and I strived to satisfy all of those needs.

Optimizations
I eventually want to add a carousel that shows a bunch of my projects in it. I also am considering adding a hamburger menu when the site is displayed on smaller devices. As a developer i'm constantly growing so as the skills come I will implement them.

Lessons Learned:
After talking to alot of developers and seeing a bunch of other developers portfolios i've learned that you're portfolio is a proper representation of you and everyones will be different. At first I didn't know what my purpose was with this portfolio and after I grasped that I was able to work more effective
