      <p class="about2">
        Hello I'm Rakim. I'm a full-stack developer and Resilient Coders alum.
        <br />
        I've just finished an internship with 6 River Systems, a robotics
        company <br />
        in Waltham. I worked on an application that mapped a nationwide database
        <br />
        of warehouses and robots, as well as running different types of tests to
        ensure <br />
        new locations could be added and functioned properly. I'm looking to
        join a <br />
        team that shares my passion for development and my drive to solve
        problems with code.

      <h1 class="title">Vegan Restaurant Directory</h1>
      <p class="description">
        This project is a search directory for vegan restaurants in Boston. I
        have provided a map that shows the users current location and shows
        restaurants so they can identify restaurants close to them. I have also
        provided a list of all the restaurants and the option for the user to
        find restaurants within a 1-5 mile radius. I've also provided a bit of
        info about each restaurant along with a link to the their menu.
